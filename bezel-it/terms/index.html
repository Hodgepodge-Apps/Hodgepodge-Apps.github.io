<h2>Bezel It Terms of Use</h2>
<p><i>Last updated: 01-29-2023</i></p>
<h3>Bezel It Pro Version</h3>
<p>To get the Pro Version, you can either purchase a yearly subscription to the app or purchase it for a lifetime. The Pro Version will unlock all device bezels for you to use, and purchasing either the subscription or the lifetime option will get you the same additional features.</p>
<p>There are a couple things to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>As new operating systems get released by Apple every year, I will periodically be dropping support for older versions. You are still able to use Bezel It if the operating system that you are using is no longer supported, but newer features might not be available to you.</li>
<li>If you purchased a subscription and it ends, you will no longer have access to the Pro Version features until you subscribe for another year.</li>
<li>If Bezel It is removed from the App Store, your subscription or lifetime purchase ends and you are not entitled to a refund.</li>
<li>I will try to keep each device bezel available for you to use as long as possible, but I reserve the right to remove any device bezel from the app. You are not entitled to a refund when a bezel is removed.</li>
</ul>
